# exchange_price_comparison

A Python script that connects to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to compare live prices and find arbitrage opportunities.

- Connects to public APIs for Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Gemini, and OKX.
- Fetches **live bid/ask prices** for assets like BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and more.
- Compares prices across exchanges and calculates **spreads**.

- Optionally plots **Coinbase mid prices over time**.
- Logs profitable arbitrage opportunities to a CSV file with timestamps.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Price comparison tables with colored spread indicators.
